# Contract
- All work must be made through commits, I'm not accepting work through Docs/email/discord/etc.
- When you make a commit, I will notify you if I accept it or reject it.
- If it's accepted, I will give you the thumbs up to integrate it into main.py, or any other required modules.
- If it's rejected, I will tell you what needs to be fixed, and I will accept it once the code is acceptable.
- Please spend 'some' time at home working on your modules.
- Everyone should have their own branch of the master branch.
- Please do 'all' of your work within your branch, and only commit a merge once 'all' work is completed.
- Workflow updates will be posted on the Trello page that will be linked through discord.
